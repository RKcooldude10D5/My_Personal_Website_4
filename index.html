        <h1>Inspiration For Drawing Automobiles</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I used to have a blue toy car which I loved to play with. I tried drawing it, but it didn't come out as expected, but it was good. I saw cars on the road, on an advertisement, images of them, etc, and started sketching them. Then I gradualy became good at it and I even started drawing the interior, exterior, engine, etc. Then, one day my father saw me drawing the wheels and said "It's not perfectly round, also, I think it's time to do 3D designs". He then showed me a video of drawing a 3D vehicle precisely. I tried drawing it, but it still wasn't 3 dimensional and precise, so I sticked to drawing the way I used to draw. I became better and better at it, then my father thought it was time I drew realistic cars. He showed me a sketch of a Lamborghini and told me to draw it. I drew it, but there were many mistakes. I started drawing cars like that everyday and my mistakes kept on improving. Then I had 2 other problems. I always used to sketch vehicles in a way that the front looked bigger and the roof wasn't always presice. My father told me those mistakes but I never understood them, so he showed me an image of a LaFerrari and a futuristic Maruti Suzuki 800 and explained me the mistakes again. I improved my mistakes and started drawing better cars. Now, I draw really great vehicles in less time.</p>
